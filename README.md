Ionic2-Meteor-Messenger
-----------------------

`ionic2-meteor-messenger` is a step-by-step tutorial that will guide you on how to create a messenger app using:

- [ionic2](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/)
- [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
- [angular2](https://angular.io/)
- [angular2-meteor](https://www.angular-meteor.com/angular2)
- [webpack](https://www.webpac.com/)

Despite `angular` team's recommendation the messenger app is written using `es6` and not `typescript`, since lots of people are not yet familiar with `typescript` and I wanted to keep it simple so people can focus on the implementation rather than trying to figure up the syntax. A `typescript` version of this tutorial might be implemented in the future.

In addition, the messenger app was created using `ionic`'s CLI. The same result could be achieved using `meteor`'s CLI, but I also wanted to go through the bundling process using `webpack`, therefore `meteor`'s build system would have prevented me from doing so. A `meteor` CLI version of this tutorial might be implemented in the future.

A step-by-step version of this app exists in the [step-by-step branch](https://github.com/DAB0mB/ionic2-meteor-messenger/tree/step-by-step), and it's tutorial is written in the [tutorial dir](https://github.com/DAB0mB/ionic2-meteor-messenger/tree/master/tutorial) of this repository. A blog post will be posted in the near future regarding this tutorial including some detailed information about each commit and screenshots.
